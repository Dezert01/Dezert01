# Jakub Kozłowski aka Dezert
I'm Jakub from Poland and I'm second year IT student on Poznań University of Technology. I like learning any programming languages but I'm mostly into front-end.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JS / jQuery
* Little bit of VUE

#### Wanna learn
* React / React Native
* any other JS Framework

## Experience
* My adventure with front-end started in primary school, when out of curiosity I started learning how to create websites.
* In 2020 I graduated from high school in the field of IT.
* After high school, together with my friend we created our **very first**, small project for FiveM server called [@Glibcat](https://github.com/Glibcat), that is **already closed**.
* Currently I'm working for [@RealmRoleplay](https://github.com/RealmRoleplay) where I create front-end for scripts available on FiveM roleplay server.

## Examples of Work
#### Glibcat MDT - FiveM Script
* My very first project with collaboration with my friend (we had no idea about anything)
