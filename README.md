# Jakub Kozłowski
I'm Jakub from Poland and I'm first year student of master studies at Software Engineering at Poznań University of Technology. I like learning any programming languages but I'm mostly into front-end.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JS / jQuery
* React / React Native

## Experience
* My adventure with front-end started in primary school, when out of curiosity I started learning how to create websites.
* In 2020 I graduated from high school in the field of IT.
* After high school, together with my friend we created our **very first**, small project for FiveM server called @Glibcat, that is **already closed**.
* Currently I'm working for [@RealmRoleplay](https://github.com/RealmRoleplay) where I create front-end for scripts available on FiveM roleplay server.
