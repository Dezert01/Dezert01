## Experience
My adventure with front-end started in primary school,when out of curiosity I satrted learning how to create websites.<br/>
I graduated from high school in the field of IT.
Together with my friend we created small project for FiveM server called @Glibcat that is already closed.
Currently I'm working for @RealmRoleplay where I create front-end for scripts available on FiveM roleplay server.
